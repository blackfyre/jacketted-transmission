# Jacketted Transmission

While there's `transmission-rss` available, it didn't suit my use case, hence the reason to create this little piece of code to start downloads with Transmission from an RSS source provided by Jackett.

# Usage

You need to set the necessary parameters in a `config.yml` file, you can use `config.example.yml` as an example to configure the Jackett Feeds and your Transmission instance.

After that, you can setup cron jobs to start processing the feeds.
